# JET uptime check. Runs on a GitHub Actions schedule (see .github/workflows/uptime.yml).
# DOWN means: connection failure/timeout, or HTTP 5xx after retries. 4xx counts as UP,
# because a Cloudflare bot challenge or an auth wall proves the site is reachable.
# Alerts go to ntfy (Jay's phone): once on the down transition, a reminder every hour
# while still down, and once on recovery.

  # stale, has never happened, or cannot be read. It is here rather than in an
  # email because the canary is deliberately silent when healthy, so this is

# Every site here is a page, and for a page any answer proves reachability, so
# a 4xx counts as UP: a Cloudflare bot challenge or an auth wall is not an
# outage, and the real one was a 522. The canary probes are not pages. Their
# entire contract IS the status code, and the two ways they can be wrong are a
# 503 (gone stale) and a 404 (the route is gone, or was never deployed).
# Under the general rule that 404 would read as UP and the dead man's switch
# would sit green forever, which is a check that cannot fail. The flatsome.css
# asset is a page dependency, not a page: a real static asset never legitimately
# answers 4xx, so unlike the pages above, a 429/404 here means "reachable but
# wrong" and must be treated as down, not tolerated as a bot challenge. L249.
