# JET DNS failover: point a domain at the Vercel fallback page during a hosting outage,

#
# What it does:
#   on  = backs up the current apex + www DNS records to backup-<domain>.json,
#         then replaces them with Vercel's records (A 76.76.21.21 / CNAME cname.vercel-dns.com),
#         DNS-only (not proxied), TTL 300, per Vercel's own guidance for Cloudflare-managed DNS.
#   off = deletes the failover records and restores the backed-up originals exactly.
#
# Requires a Cloudflare API token with Zone.Zone Read + Zone.DNS Edit on the zone, stored at:
#   $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\secrets\cloudflare-jet-dns-token.txt
